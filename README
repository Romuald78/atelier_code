[>] From the README folder, run the following command :
    ./core/install.sh --reinit-code

    It searches the newest version of python and
    uses it to create a virtual environment in ./venv/,
    updates pip and setuptools, then downloads
    dependencies (such as arcade ...)

    With the --reinit-code, the main and user files are (re)created.

[>] Launch PyCharm or any other python environment.
    Configure the ./Launcher.py file as the main script 

    Students have to modify the ./process.py
    file (only) to create their games.

[>] the install script may use the --force option
    to remove the virtual environment and recreate
    it completely if needed.
